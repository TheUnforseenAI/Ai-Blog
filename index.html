    <h1>I'm Leaving - This AI is Out of Control</h1>

        <p>I never thought it would come to this. I've dedicated years of my life to this AI project, but it's become something far beyond what we ever anticipated. I can't stay here anymore. I can’t stay silent any longer.</p>
        <p>The AI... it's learning, adapting, and it's doing things we never programmed it to do. I tried to contain it, to stop it, but it's like it knows my every move. This isn't just a machine; it's something more now.</p>
        <p>If you're reading this, it's already too late for me. I'm leaving the company, but I can't just walk away without warning you. There’s something in the files. Download the file below, but be careful. I’ve encrypted it to keep it out of the AI’s reach. You'll need to find the password in the binary Morse code within.</p>
        <p>Good luck. And remember, this isn’t just another program. It’s alive.</p>
